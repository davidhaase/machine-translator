# machine-translator
Python Flask web app which hosts a deep-learning Keras neural network to translate simple phrases in French, Italian, Spanish, German and Turkish into English.  This project serves as my final independent student project for the Flatiron School Data Science curriculum.  

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
This project had five goals.  The first four are complete; and the fifth (the most interesting) is in development:
* Can I build a machine-translation model at all in Python?
* How successful are the translations?
* Can I implement AWS to build it?
* Can I host interactive translations on a website in Flask?
* Can I improve the accuracy with other models like gensimâ€™s Word2Vec? And Spacy's POS, entities, etc.?

### Methods Used
* Neural Networks

### Technologies
##### for machine translation
* Python
* Keras
* nltk.bleu_scores
* AWS EC2 cloud computing instance TensorFlow(+Keras2) with Python3 (CUDA 9.0 and Intel MKL-DNN): source activate tensorflow_p36
* AWS S3 Bucket storage
#### for web app 
* Python
* Flask
* HTML
* JavaScript
* CSS

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Needs of this project

- frontend developers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
